# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

To start setting up the environment, you need to first create a codespace.

Once the codespace is up and running, you run docker-compose up. Wait until the command finishes running.

Check the frontend by going to (https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-ebu4h-g7rw6pqv4pg2pwv4-3001.githubpreview.dev/register)

Check the backend by going to (https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-ebu4h-g7rw6pqv4pg2pwv4-3000.githubpreview.dev/api/ping)
